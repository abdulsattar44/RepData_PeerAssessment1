## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo=TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip", junkpaths = TRUE)
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv")

activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date)

head(activityData)

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
totalSteps <- activityData %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(total = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
# Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(totalSteps$total)
```
```{r}
# Mean & Median of the total number of steps taken per day
meanSteps <- mean(totalSteps$total, na.rm = TRUE)
medianSteps <- median(totalSteps$total, na.rm = TRUE)

meanSteps
medianSteps
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
averageDailyActivity <- activityData %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarize(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

with(averageDailyActivity, plot(x = interval, y = average_steps, type = "l",
                                xlab = "5 min Intervals in a day",
                                ylab = "Average Number of Steps", 
                                main = "The Average Daily Activity Pattern"))
```




## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
